# TODO packages
- in the label of the isomorphism classes we replaced some "." with "-". This might require some changes in the code or in the upload function
- make a swipe of the Pic code to check that it matches with the paper
    - the test at the bottom of the file fails!!! Is it a but in AbelianInvariants (which returns an empty list when the group is trivial...)
    - are the exponents starting from 0 or 1? (see referee report)
    - there might have been a sorting issue...[need to make sure that the magma convention overlaps with ours]
- several TODOs in Isogenies.m, about documenting and adding tests

# TODO computation
- all Attach in scripts needs to be updated
- start making a plan: how many scripts? which temporary files?
- update the scripts
- add a script about pAdicPosElt
- the size of the isogeny class needs to be recomputed as well. This should be a separate run.

# NOT URGENT
- the first part of IsProductOfOrdersLMFDB (the one without the sorting) can be included in AlgEt
- clean-up/remove LMFDB folder in AbVarFq

# diary
- I have renamed IsProduct to IsProductOfOrdersLMFDB
