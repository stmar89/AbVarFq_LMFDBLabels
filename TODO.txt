# TODO list
- clean-up/remove LMFDB folder in AbVarFq
- the first part of IsProductOfOrdersLMFDB (the one without the sorting) can be included in AlgEt
- all Attach needs to be updated
- in the label of the isomorphism classes we replaced some "." with "-". This might require some changes in the code or in the upload function
- make a swipe of the Pic code to check that it matches with the paper
    in particular: are the exponents starting from 0 or 1? (see referee report)
    there might have been a sorting issue...[need to make sure that the magma convention overlaps with ours]


# diary
- I have renamed IsProduct to IsProductOfOrdersLMFDB
